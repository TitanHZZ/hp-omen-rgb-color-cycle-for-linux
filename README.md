# hp-omen-rgb-color-cycle-for-linux
Small c++ program capable of giving you a rgb color cycle for your hp omen laptop keyboard. Please Note that in order for this to work you will need to first install this repository -> https://github.com/pelrun/hp-omen-linux-module. After that you will need to compile the code (and take a look at it if you want), and to do so just run this command -> "g++ keyboard_rgb.cpp -o keyboard_rgb". This small app will need sudo permissions to run, so run the app like this-> "sudo ./keyboard_rgb"
